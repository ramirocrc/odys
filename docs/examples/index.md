# Examples

These examples walk through common Odys use cases, from a basic dispatch
problem to risk-aware market participation.

Each example is self-contained -- you can copy-paste it and run it directly.

| Example | What it shows |
|---|---|
| [Basic Dispatch](basic_dispatch.md) | Cheapest generation meeting a fixed load |
| [Battery Dispatch](battery_dispatch.md) | Using storage to shift solar output over time |
| [Flexible Load Market](flexible_load_market.md) | Shifting industrial consumption to low-price hours |
| [Market Arbitrage](market_arbitrage.md) | Choosing between self-generation and market purchases |
| [CVaR Market Risk](cvar_market_risk.md) | Risk-aware market allocation under uncertainty |
| [EV Fleet Optimization](ev_fleet_optimization.md) | V2G arbitrage, trip constraints, and charger competition |
