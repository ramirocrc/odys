Python framework for optimizing multi-energy systems

# About The Project

**Optimes** is a Python framework for modeling and optimizing multi-energy systems using mathematical optimization techniques. It provides tools for creating, configuring, and optimizing energy systems with generators, batteries, and other energy assets.

### Why use optimes?

Optimes simplifies energy system optimization by providing:

- :jigsaw: **Seamless integration** with mathematical optimization solvers (HiGHS, Pyomo, etc.).
- :repeat: **Flexible workflows** that allow for modeling various energy assets and system configurations.
- :hammer_and_wrench: **Comprehensive tools** for asset modeling, portfolio management, and optimization.
- :building_construction: **Production-ready models** with clear interfaces for energy system optimization.

Whether you're building energy system prototypes or deploying optimization models in production, optimes ensures a fast, reliable, and scalable experience.
