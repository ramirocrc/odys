"""Risk-aware market allocation with CVaR.

This example shows how Odys can trade off expected profit against downside
risk. The same generation can look attractive in expectation but still be a bad
choice once uncertain market prices are taken into account.

## Assets

- **ccgt**: 100 MW gas turbine, variable cost of 20 $/MWh, fully available
  across all scenarios.

## Markets

- **sdac**: Sell-only market with non-anticipative decisions (stage_fixed=True).
  Prices vary slightly by scenario: 190, 200, 210 $/MWh.
- **sidc**: Sell-only market with uncertain prices (stage_fixed=False).
  Prices vary by scenario: 280 (high), 200 (mid), 140 (low) $/MWh.

## Problem

We simulate a single 24-hour timestep with three equally likely scenarios.
The optimizer allocates the ccgt's 100 MW generation between two markets,
both with uncertain prices but different risk profiles.

Two optimizations are run:
1. **Expected profit only**: Maximize expected profit without CVaR penalty.
2. **With CVaR penalty (weight = 1)**: Penalize risk (downside exposure).

## Scenario Data

| Scenario | Probability | sdac Price | sidc Price | sdac Profit | sidc Profit |
|----------|-------------|------------|------------|-------------|-------------|
| high     | 1/3         | 190 $/MWh  | 280 $/MWh  | 17,000      | 26,000      |
| mid      | 1/3         | 200 $/MWh  | 200 $/MWh  | 18,000      | 18,000      |
| low      | 1/3         | 210 $/MWh  | 140 $/MWh  | 19,000      | 12,000      |

(Profit = (price - 20) * 100 MW)

## Expected Profit Analysis

**sdac (uncertain, but non-anticipative):**
- E[profit] = (17,000 + 18,000 + 19,000) / 3 = 18,000

**sidc (uncertain):**
- Allocating to sidc, the optimizer sells in all scenarios (all prices > 20)
- High: 100 MW at 280 → 26,000
- Mid: 100 MW at 200 → 18,000
- Low: 100 MW at 140 → 12,000
- **E[profit] = (26,000 + 18,000 + 12,000) / 3 = 18,667**
- **sidc has 667 higher expected profit than sdac**

## CVaR Analysis (confidence_level = 0.6)

The objective uses: CVaR_expr = VaR - 2.5 x E[shortfall]
(with 2.5 = 1 / (1 - 0.6))

**For sdac:** Profits: [17,000, 18,000, 19,000]
- VaR (60th percentile) = 18,000
- Shortfalls: z_low = 18,000 - 17,000 = 1,000, z_mid = 0, z_high = 0
- E[shortfall] = (1,000 + 0 + 0) / 3 ≈ 333
- CVaR_expr = 18,000 - 2.5 x 333 ≈ **17,167**

**For sidc:** Profits: [12,000, 18,000, 26,000]
- VaR (60th percentile) = 18,000
- Shortfalls: z_low = 18,000 - 12,000 = 6,000, z_mid = 0, z_high = 0
- E[shortfall] = (6,000 + 0 + 0) / 3 = 2,000
- CVaR_expr = 18,000 - 2.5 x 2,000 = **13,000**

## Objective Function

Objective = profit_weight x E[profit] + cvar_weight x CVaR_expr

### Run 1: Expected Profit Only (no CVaR)

| Market | E[Profit] | Objective Value |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|
| sdac   | 18,000    | 18,000          |
| sidc   | 18,667    | 18,667          |

**Result:** sidc wins (18,667 > 18,000)
- sidc has 667 higher expected profit than sdac
- Optimizer sells 100 MW to sidc in all scenarios

### Run 2: With CVaR Penalty (weight = 1)

The optimizer now finds an optimal mix rather than a pure allocation, since both
markets have uncertainty:

- **sdac**: ~87.5 MW in all scenarios (non-anticipative)
- **sidc**: ~12.5 MW in all scenarios

**Result:** sdac dominates the allocation (~87.5% vs ~12.5%)
- The CVaR penalty favors the lower-variance market
- A meaningful sidc position captures upside in favorable scenarios
- Lower variance becomes more valuable than higher (but riskier) expected profit

## Critical CVaR Weight

There exists a critical CVaR weight above which the optimizer shifts from
primarily sidc to primarily sdac. Below this threshold, the higher expected
profit of sidc dominates; above it, the lower downside risk of sdac wins.

- **No CVaR (w = 0)**: Optimizer chooses **sidc** (higher expected profit)
- **Low CVaR weight**: Optimizer still prefers **sidc** (expected profit dominates)
- **High CVaR weight**: Optimizer shifts to **sdac** (downside risk dominates)

With the reduced sidc variance, the transition is more gradual. Both solutions
show meaningful allocations to both markets, making the tradeoff clearer.

## Key Insight

This example is really about the shape of the decision, not just the final
profit number. A purely expected-value objective prefers the riskier market,
but once downside risk is penalized, the lower-variance market becomes more
attractive. That is the core value of CVaR: it makes the optimizer care about
bad outcomes, not only the average one.
