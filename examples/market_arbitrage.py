"""Market arbitrage with a buy-only electricity market.

This example adds a market to the dispatch problem so the optimizer can choose
between self-generation and buying energy. It is a good way to see how Odys
compares operating cost against market price.

## Assets

- **ccgt**: 100 MW gas turbine, variable cost of 50 $/MWh, fully available
  24/7.
- **load**: Fixed electricity demand of 70 MW.
- **market**: Energy market with buy-only capability, max 100 MW per timestep.

## Problem

We simulate 24 hourly periods with a constant 70 MW load.
Market prices change over time, so the optimizer has to decide step by step
whether it is cheaper to generate locally or buy from the market.

## Expected Results

The optimizer buys from the market whenever the market price is below the
ccgt's marginal cost of 50 $/MWh. When the market is more expensive, the gas
plant takes over.

Market prices vary throughout the day, with some hours below 50 $/MWh and
others above, creating arbitrage opportunities.

For example:
- When market price = 80 $/MWh: ccgt = 70 MW  # price > 50, generate
- When market price = 40 $/MWh: market = 70 MW  # price < 50, buy
- When market price = 30 $/MWh: market = 70 MW  # price < 50, buy

## Understanding the Output

The script prints:
- Generator dispatch as a DataFrame showing ccgt output at each timestep
- (Market purchases can be viewed via result.markets)

Because the market is buy-only, the optimizer never sells excess power. That
keeps the example focused on a single question: when should you generate, and
when should you simply buy?
