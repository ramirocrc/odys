    """Represents a flexible load asset in the energy system.

    A flexible load is an energy asset that can adjust its consumption within
    specified bounds to optimize profit. The optimizer can increase or decrease
    the load from its base profile based on economic incentives.

    The decision to adjust load depends on the relationship between the
    value_of_consumption (economic value of consuming electricity) and the
    marginal cost of supply. The marginal cost is determined implicitly by
    the power balance constraint: when the optimizer increases load, it must
    procure more energy from the cheapest available source (generators or
    markets). When it decreases load, it frees up that supply for other uses
    (e.g., selling to markets).

    When value_of_consumption exceeds the marginal supply cost, increasing
    load is profitable. When the marginal supply cost exceeds
    value_of_consumption, decreasing load saves money.
