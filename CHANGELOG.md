# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.1] - 2026-08-04

### Added

- EV fleet optimization: `ElectricVehicle`, `Charger`, and `Trip` entities for modeling electric vehicle charging with trip constraints
- `StandaloneStorage` as the user-facing storage class for stationary battery assets
- Flexible loads: adjustable demand that optimizer can increase/decrease within bounds
- `FlexibleLoadDispatch` results class with `load_adjustment` and `actual_load` properties
- `results.flexible_loads` API for accessing flexible load dispatch results
- `Storage.degradation_cost` is now included in the objective function, applied to total energy throughput (charge + discharge) converted to MWh via the scenario timestep

### Changed

- **Breaking:** `Storage` is now an abstract base class; use `StandaloneStorage` for stationary battery assets
- **Breaking:** `Storage.max_power` split into `max_charge_power` and `max_discharge_power` to support asymmetric charge/discharge limits
- **Breaking:** `AssetPortfolio.storages` renamed to `AssetPortfolio.standalone_storages`
- Relaxed power demand validation for flexible loads to account for max_decrease capability
- Updated error message in `per_scenario_profit` to include flexible loads as a valid profit source
- `Storage.degradation_cost` now defaults to `0.0` instead of `None`, matching `Generator.startup_cost`. **Breaking:** explicitly passing `degradation_cost=None` is no longer accepted; omit the field or pass a float.
